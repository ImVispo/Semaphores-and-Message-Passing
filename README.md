## Semaphores and message passing project

The goal of this project was to become familiar with concurrent processing in Unix/Linux using shared memory and with semaphores in POSIX-based operating systems.

This program simulates a swim mill that shows the behavior of a fish swimming upstream. Somewhere upstream, a pellet is dropped into the stream, and our fish will start traveling towards it sideways to capture it. 

### Implementation

The code for `pellet`, `fish`, and `swim_mill` processes should be compiled separately and the executables be named `pellet`, `fish`, and `swim_mill`, respectively. The program should be executed by calling: `swim_mill`.
